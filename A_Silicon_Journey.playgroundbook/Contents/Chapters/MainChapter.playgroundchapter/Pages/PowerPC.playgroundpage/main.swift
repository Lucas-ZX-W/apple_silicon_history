 In 1991, an alliance was born between Apple, IBM¬Æ, and Motorola¬Æ to develop the PowerPC‚Ñ¢
 architecture of RISC CPUs, entering a consumer computing market then dominated with
 Intel¬Æ's x86 CISC CPUs.

 The first PowerPC‚Ñ¢ Macintosh computers were released in 1994 equipped with the PowerPC‚Ñ¢ 601
 processor. The transition to PowerPC‚Ñ¢ from the Motorola 68000 CISC architecture marked the first
 appearance of a RISC archiecture in Apple computers. Throuhgout the 1990s and the early 2000s,
 the Macintosh/Mac's PowerPC‚Ñ¢ CPUs performed formiadably with Intel¬Æ's x86 Pentium‚Ñ¢ series.
 
 However, as the 2000s carried on, the computing world would start taking new shapes. It was during
 this time that RISC found both its olive branch in the ultra-portable segment with the arm
 architecture powering devices such as the iPod, and its (temporary?) end in the
 desktop/laptop computing segment as PowerPC‚Ñ¢'s unstellar power to performance ratio. This meant
 that these power hungry PowerPC‚Ñ¢ chips were not suitable for laptops as well as becoming
 increasingly uncompetitive with Intel's advancements in both performance and power efficiency,
 two very important factors in a growing mobile market.
 
 However, was it ever this simple?
