 # Is that a MacBook Air!? üíª
 
 Well, it's not just any MacBook Air. That's the new(er) Apple Silicon MacBook Air
 released last November!
 
 Hmmmm, but it kinda looks exactly like the Late 2018 MacBook Air though, I wonder
 what's so special about it? ü§î
 
 Well, aside from the fact that a complete redesign isn't yet here, there's some
 vErY interesting things inside that laptop.
 
 Hmmmmm, I wonder what that could possibly be? üßê
 
 Well, in order to know that, we must take a trip down memory line, down the vertex of
 time to the one that started it all!
 
 **Note: for all pages:**
 If the camera pops up, move your device around so that it can detect a horizontal surface to put
 things on!
 
 If there appears to be no option to go to the next page,
 please wait for a tiny bit as you seem to be a fast reader!
